Course work that I did by order.
Branch `work_version` contains the original version of the project for delivery which includes the specific requirements
of the lecturer. Original version contains CRUD api for csv, xml and jdbc. 
`master' branch is the same project but refactored and I also replace JDBC with Hibernate to work with DB.

The project in the `master` branch is exclusively educational in nature and was created for the practice of working with hibernate.
I relied on information in the book `Java Persistence with Hibernate` modifying the project
