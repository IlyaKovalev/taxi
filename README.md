Course work that I did by order.
Branch `work_version` consist the original version of the project for delivery which includes the specific requirements
of the lecturer
`master' branch is the same project but refactored already and I also replace JDBC with Hibernate to work with the DB.

The project in the `master` branch is exclusively educational in nature and was created for the practice of working with hibernate 
only.
I relied on the book `Java Persistence with Hibernate` modifying the project
